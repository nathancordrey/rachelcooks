# Fig Chutney

Pairs well with the Sunday Pork Tenderloin! First had it on Mother's Day 2023

## Ingredients


- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 cups of figs (washed stems removed and quartered)
- 1/2 large tart apple
- 1 small vidalia or white onion
- 1/3 cup golden raisins
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground clove or allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

## Instructions


1. Soak raisins in a bowl of hot water while chopping figs
2. Bring vinegar and sugar to a boil in a sauce pan
3. Once sugar is dissolved add figs apples onion, raisins, salt and spices. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes
4. Reduce the heat to low for one hour stirring often

### Note:

- This recipe makes one pint jar

IMPORTANT: If processing by water bath canning, add 1 tbs of bottled lemon juice to the pint jar before adding chutney. Process for 15 minutes with a rolling boil. Lift the lid and turn the heat off. Remove after 5 more minutes.

- Chutney is thickened to completion when you run a spoon across the bottom of the pan and liquid doesn’t immediately fill the space
- Don’t forget to taste your food!
