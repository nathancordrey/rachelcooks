# Sourdough Bagels

Sourdough bagels! They are simple to work up the night before, proof overnight and bake in the morning.

## Ingredients


- 150 g (3/4 cup) Bubbly Active Sourdough Starter
- 250 g (1 cup plus 2 tsp) warm water (winter 85-95F, summer 55-60 F)
- 24g (2 tbsp) granulated sugar
- 500g (4 cups plus 2 tbsp) Good Quality Bread Flour (i.e. King Arthur)
- 9g (1 1/2 tsp) fine sea salt
- Cooking spray or oil, (for coating the plastic wrap)
- 20 g (1 tbsp) Honey for the hot water bath
- Optional mixed toppings (Everything Bagel, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, etc.)


## Instructions


1. Mix the dough – Whisk the water, sourdough starter and sugar together in a large bowl. Add the flour and salt. Combine to forma rough dough, then finish mixing by hand until no lumps remain. The dough will be very stiff and dry. Optional to use a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; run on low speed for 5 to 6 minutes to combine and knead.
2. Cover the dough with a damp towl and let rest for 45 minutes to 1 hour. After the dough has rested, work the mass into a semi-smooth ball, about 15 to 20 seconds.
3. Bulk Rise: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap that has been lightly coated in oil to prevent sticking. Let rise until double in size, about 10-12 hours when the temperature is 68F (20C); 8 to 10 hours @ 70F (21C). Note: In the summer, rise the dough during the day. Once teh dough is almost double in size, cover and chill the bowl overnight (It will continue to rise slightly in the fridge). Proceed using the cold dough the following day
4. Shape: Line a sheet pan with a nonstick silicone mat or parchment paper. If using parchment, lightly coat with cooking spray or oil to prevent sticking.
5. Remove the dough onto a non-floured work surface. Flatten teh dough into a rectangle and divide into 8 equal pieces, about 115 g each. Gather the ends, flip the dough over, and roll each piece into a ball. Let the dough rest on your lined sheet pan for 10 to 15 minutes to relax the gluten.
6. Working with one ball of dough at a time, poke a hole straight through the center. Move your finger around in a circular motion to gently stretch the dough until the hole is about the size of a walnut. You can also lift up the dough, insert both index fingers through the center hole, and barrel roll to gently stretch the opening. When finished, place the dough back onto the sheet pan. It’s okay if the hole shrinks slightly. Repeat shaping the remaining dough
7. Second Rise: Cover the dough with a damp paper towel and let rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. The dough will puff up only slightly at this stage.’
8. Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the honey and whisk well to dissolve. Preheat your oven to 425F. Add the seeds to a rimmed tray or shallow bowl.
9. Boil the bagels: Add 2 to 3 bagels into the pot and simmer for 30 seconds on each side for a thin crust. Note:if using cold dough from the fridge, the bagels might not float to the surface right away. Give them a nudge after 30 seconds or so and be patient. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bagels back to the sheet pan you used earlier, placing them rounded side up.
10. Once slightly cool but still wet, dip the rounded side of the bagels into the seeds to coat. Place back onto the sheet pan and finish boiling the rest of the bagels.
11. Bake: in the oven for 20-25 minutes at 425F. Flip them over briefly to cook the bottom side, about 1 to 2 minutes or less. When ready, your bagels will be puffed up, light golden brown, and feel light to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
12. Store in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Bagels also freeze well; covered in plastic wrap and a layer of foil, for up to 3 months.
